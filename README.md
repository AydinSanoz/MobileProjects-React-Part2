### The easiest way to convert your screenrecording to gif.


- Save your screen recording as the name ' in.mov'
- open a terminal at the same folder in.mov file.
- if not installed this do these first

```bash
brew install ffmpeg 
brew cask install xquartz #dependency for gifsicle, only required for mountain-lion and above
open /usr/local/Cellar/x-quartz/2.7.4/XQuartz.pkg # runs the XQuartz installer (YOU NEED TO UPDATE THE PATH)
brew install gifsicle
```
Then

```shell
- paste this command line to your terminal 
  ffmpeg -i in.mov -s 600x400 -pix_fmt rgb24 -r 10 -f gif - | gifsicle --optimize=3 --delay=3 > out.gif
```

<!-- ```c++
int foo() {
    int result = 4;
    return result;
}
``` 

```c++
int foo() { 
    int x = 4;
    return x;
}
```
